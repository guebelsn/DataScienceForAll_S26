    "**Rules.** Don't share your code with anybody. You are welcome to discuss your project with other students, but don't share your project details or copy a project from the internet. This project should be YOUR OWN (code, etc.). If you do base your project on something you learned online or through a generative AI tool such as ChatGPT, make sure to check with your instructor before getting started and reference your sources as part of this project. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for the final exam (and life). During the final lab session, you will have a chance to share with the whole class.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Advice.** Develop your project incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. Don't hesitate to add more names/variables or functions if this helps with your analysis or classifier development. Also, please be sure to not re-assign variables throughout the notebook! For example, if you use max_temperature in your answer to one question, do not reassign it later on.\n",
